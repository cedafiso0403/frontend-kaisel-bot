<h1>PROJECT KAISEL</h1>
<p>
  Project Kaisel is an easy to use web-application for displaying game statistics for the current season. Kaisel displays the current season statistics for a searched player for League of Legends and can display the top ranked players for every region for VALORANT. Kaisel is also integrated with the Twitch API which simply gets the top streamers exclusively for League of Legends, VALORANT, and Teamfight Tactics. It is designed to help players easily access their statistics as well as explore the top streamers playing games supported by Riot.
